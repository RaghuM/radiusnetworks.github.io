## Museum Guide

The Museum Guide app lets you set up a customized tour guide for small museums, galleries, and other locations where you would like a virtual tour.  Simply place iBeacons at locations to be included in the tour, and configure their identifiers with the app.

You may either create a custom app based on our open source examples for Android and iOS, or by useour own app available in the app stores.  If you decide to use our app you can set up an 8-digit museum code to share with your visitors.  Your museum guide  can be up and going in just a couple of hours!

The app is built on top of our Proximity Kit cloud service for iBeacons, which makes it possible to do all your app's iBeacon configuration in the cloud.  This configurability is what makes creating different Museum Guides with the same app possible.
