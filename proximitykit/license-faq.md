##Proximity Kit and Pro Android iBeacon Library License FAQ

###Q: How much does a license cost?

###A: The cost varies depending on active installs.

A developer license for up to 100 active installs is free.  Monthly license costs for additional active install counts are:

<table>

<tr><td>1000-10,000</td><td>$49</td></tr>
<tr><td>10,000-25,000</td><td>$122</td></tr>

<tr><td>250,000-500,000</td><td>$2200</td></tr>

</table>

###Q: How are active installs counted?

###A: Active installs are counted on a 30-day cycle.

We define an "active install" as an app installed on a device which makes at least one call to a Radius Networks library within the 30-day cycle.

The number of active installs will generally be fewer than the total number of devices with your app installed.

### Q: What happens if my app goes over the limits of my license?

###A: Your app will continue to work normally.

We'll send you a note to your registered email address with a count of the app installs that have used the library in the last month,
along with instructions for upgrading your license.  Again, don't worry -- your app will not stop working.

###Q: What if millions of users install my app unexpectedly?

###A: Congratulations -- this is a great problem to have!

If the license cost for your active installs spikes, just contact us and we can work out a plan that doesn't break the bank.  We're app developers too, so
we understand these things happen.

Users of the Proximity Kit client library agree to abide by the license terms as specified for [iOS](proximity-kit-ios-license.txt) and [Android](proximity-kit-android-license.txt).
