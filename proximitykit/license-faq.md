###Q: How much does a license cost?

###Q: How are active installs counted?

###A: Active installs are counted on a 30-day cycle.

An active install is considered an app installed on a device that uses a Radius Networks library at least once in a 30 day period.
This includes apps that are launched by the user, send notifications from the background, or perform any other app-defined action based on the
detected proximity to an iBeacon or a geofence.  Accounting of installs is based on four factors:

1. The number of devices with your app installed

2. The percentage of users who interact with your app within any month

3. Whether iBeacons are detected or geofences are crossed for an app install in a given month (if your app uses these features.)

4. Under what circumstances your app uses the features of the libraries

The number of active installs will generally be fewer than the total number of devices with your app installed.

###Q: What happens if my app goes over the limits of my license?

###A: Your app will continue to work normally.

We'll send you a note to your registered email address with a count of the app installs that have used the library in the last month,
along with instructions for upgrading your license.  Again, don't worry -- your app will not stop working.

###Q: What if millions of users install my app unexpectedly?

###A: Congratulations -- this is a great problem to have!  

If the license cost for your active installs spikes, just contact us and we can work out a plan that doesn't break the bank.  We're app developers too, so
we understand these things happen.
