## iBeacon Scavenger Hunt

The iBeacon Scavenger Hunt lets you set up your own custom scavenger hunt game for iOS and Android devices.  Place iBeacons
at target locations, and configure their identifiers with the app.  

You can set up your own scavenger hunt by making a custom app based on our open source examples for Android and iOS, or by using our own app available in the app stores.  If you decide to use our app you will need to set up and distribute an 8-digit hunt code to your particpants.
